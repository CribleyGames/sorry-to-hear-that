            <p>cribley was asking how to do gemskip 2400m (probably the most free room in gemskip) so he sent a screenshot of where he was at.</p>

            <div class="bootup">
                <p>image that cribley sent in the <a href="https://discord.gg/bMx95yE" target="blank">celeste classic discord</a></p><br>
            </div>
            <p>so <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/user/Meep_Moop" target="blank">meep</a> came in to help and said to him "you dash left and try to walljump off of the left side of the ice" and then he typed a command that told the bot (celeste bot) to send a gif of gemskip 2400m.</p>
            <img src="images/8.gif">
            <div class="bootup">
                <p>2400m gemskip 2 gif. use command "!db 2300 gemskip" in the <a href="https://discord.gg/bMx95yE" target="blank">celeste classic discord</a> to see this gif</p><br>
            </div>
            <p>and then meep started explaining himself saying that "i dash left and smack into the ice, then jump and dash left again
                ". Then cribley said he doesn't even do that.</p>
            <img src="images/Screenshot 2020-05-20 at 11.52.51 AM.png"><br>
            <p>Then meep said "which made it more consistent than just jumping and dashing left" then cribley said "I don't do the first part like that". then meep said "sorry to hear that".

            <p>now after meep said that it just became a meme and now everyone says it because cribley said something stupid. and whenever someone says it cribley remembers the stupid thing he said.</p>
